<h1 align="left">Titanic Dataset- using Classification model</h1>

###

<h2 align="left">Project Description:</h2>

###

<p align="left">The 1988 dataset encompasses four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V, with a total of 76 attributes. Despite its breadth, research typically focuses on a subset of 14 attributes. The pivotal "target" field denotes the presence of heart disease, coded as 0 for absence and 1 for disease, making it a vital dataset for heart disease prediction studies.</p>

<h2 align="left">Steps-Wise in the Project:</h2>

###

<p align="left">1. Importing Libraries:Begin by importing necessary libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn.<br><br>2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Load the Titanic dataset and perform exploratory data analysis to understand its structure, summary statistics, and distributions. Explore relationships between variables and visualize survival rates based on different features.<br><br>3. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset. This may involve imputing missing values, removing outliers, and correcting data errors.<br><br>4. Preprocessing: Preprocess the data by encoding categorical variables using label encoding or one-hot encoding. Scale numerical features if necessary to ensure all features have similar scales.<br><br>5. EDA (Extended): After preprocessing, further explore the relationships between features and survival rates. Identify which features are most correlated with survival and may be important for the predictive model.<br><br>6. Model Building: Train various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, etc., using the preprocessed dataset.<br><br>7. Predictions:*Make predictions on a validation set using the trained models.<br><br>8. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision, ROC curve, and AUC score. This step helps you determine which model performs best in predicting survival outcomes.</p>

<h2 align="left">Conclusion:</h2>

###

<p align="left">Compare the performance of different models and select the one with the highest accuracy or the most suitable evaluation metric for your problem. In your case, Logistic Regression seems to be performing well with 78% accuracy.</p>
